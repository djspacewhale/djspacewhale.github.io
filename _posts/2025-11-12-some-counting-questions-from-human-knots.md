It's been a minute since I've written on here, and I do aim to finish my exposition on universal algebra (as well as some more formalization targets), but this year has been a lot.
For now, to get back into the writing-things speed, here's some pop math computations and questions.

Y'all know that [human knot game][hkw]? Here's a video of folks playing it:

My brother, who played it with some work colleagues recently, explained it to our mom as a game where everyone stands in a circle and randomly grabs hands across this circle, forming one tangled circle.
The game is then to detangle this "knot" out into one circle without letting go of each other's hands.
This got my brain going though - I'd played human knots back in my Boy Scout days but hadn't thought of them since, and regrettably my first utterance was:

## 1. Wait, just one circle?

Imagine Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Darby are making a human knot.
Alice and Charlie grab each other's hands, and Bob and Darby the same.
That's two circles now, not one!

I raised this with my brother
